# System design

## Introduction

In this guideline, I will do my best to summarize what I am learning about system design interviews.

1. What is a System design interview?
A system design interview is a conversation where the interviewer presents a real-world problem, often vague or open-ended. The interviewee is expected to clarify requirements, design an appropriate solution, and demonstrate their ability to architect a system at an application or system level.

2. What is the Purpose of This Interview Session?

The primary purposes of the system design interview are to assess the candidateâ€™s:

- **Communication skills**: Ability to discuss about complex concepts, asking clarify questions.
- **Problem-solving skills**: Approach to breaking down the complex problem, identify the key components.
- **Technical knowledge**: Understanding about system architecture, scalability, performance optimization, 
and trades off between different design choises.

## Steps

There are several steps need to be done when you receive a requirement from the interviewer. These steps belong
to two phases: Clarification and Design. The Clarification phase involves understanding the requirements, while the 
design phase focuses on creating a solution.

### Clarification (scoping)

#### Functional requirement

#### Non-functional requirement

1. Scalability

- Throughput
- Storage capacity

2. Performance

- Latency
- Availability

### Design

#### Endpoint design

#### Techstack choise

#### Database Diagram

#### System High-level design
