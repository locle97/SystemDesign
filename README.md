In generally, the purpose of system design interview is taking a real world problem,
breaking it out and try to design the core function of it.

## Steps

There are several steps need to be done when you receive a requirement from the interviewer. These steps belong
to two phases: Clarification and Design. The Clarification phase involves understanding the requirements, while the 
design phase focuses on creating a solution.
